# Low-Level Design (LLD) and Microservice Architecture for a Discussion Platform

### 1. System Overview

Our discussion platform is built on a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The platform allows users to create accounts, post discussions, follow other users, and interact with posts through comments and likes. We will use Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose for our tech stack. We will also use RabbitMQ for inter-service communication and Nginx as a proxy.

### 2. Microservices Breakdown

We will split our system into several microservices, each handling specific functionalities:

1. **User Service**
2. **Discussion Service**
3. **Interaction Service**

### 3. Service Responsibilities and API Endpoints

#### User Service

Handles user management tasks such as creating, updating, deleting, listing, follow, and unfollow users.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - **Create User:** `POST /users/signup`
  - **Login User:** `POST /users/login`
  - **Get User Profile:** `GET /users/profile`
  - **Show List of Users:** `GET /users`
  - **Update User:** `PUT /users`
  - **Delete User:** `DELETE /users`
  - **Follow User:** `PUT /users/follow/:userId`
  - **Unfollow User:** `PUT /users/unfollow/:userId`
  - **Search User Based on Name:** `GET /users/search?name=:name`

- **Model:**
  ```javascript
  const UserSchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    phone: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, index: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, index: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true },
    salt: { type: String, required: true },
    followers: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user' }],
    following: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user' }]
  }, {
    toJSON: {
      transform(doc, ret) {
        delete ret.password;
        delete ret.salt;
        delete ret.__v;
        ret.phone = '+91' + ret.phone;
      }
    },
    timestamps: true
  });
  ```

#### Discussion Service

Manages discussions including creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - **Create Discussion:** `POST /discussions`
  - **Update Discussion:** `PUT /discussions/:discussionId`
  - **Delete Discussion:** `DELETE /discussions/:discussionId`
  - **Get List of Discussions Based on Tags:** `GET /discussions/tags?tags=:tags`
  - **Get List of Discussions Based on Text:** `GET /discussions/search?text=:text`
  - **Get Discussion by ID:** `GET /discussions/:discussionId`

- **Model:**
  ```javascript
  const DiscussionSchema = new Schema({
    userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user', required: true },
    text: { type: String, required: true },
    image: { type: String },
    hashtags: [{ type: String }],
    viewCount: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    likes: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user' }],
    createdOn: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
  }, {
    toJSON: {
      transform(doc, ret) {
        delete ret.__v;
      }
    },
    timestamps: true
  });
  ```

#### Interaction Service

Handles comments, likes, and replies on discussions.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - **Add Comment:** `POST /comments`
  - **Update Comment:** `PUT /comments/:commentId`
  - **Delete Comment:** `DELETE /comments/:commentId`
  - **Like Comment:** `PUT /comments/like/:commentId`
  - **Reply to Comment:** `PUT /comments/reply/:commentId`
  - **Like Discussion:** `PUT /discussions/like/:discussionId`

- **Model:**
  ```javascript
  const CommentSchema = new Schema({
    discussionId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'discussion', required: true },
    userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user', required: true },
    text: { type: String, required: true },
    likes: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user' }],
    replies: [{
      userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user', required: true },
      text: { type: String },
      likes: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'user' }],
      createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
    }]
  }, {
    toJSON: {
      transform(doc, ret) {
        delete ret.__v;
      }
    },
    timestamps: true
  });
  ```

### 4. Authentication

The **User Service** is responsible for handling login and signup. We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Upon successful login or signup, a JWT token will be issued. This token must be included in the headers of all protected route requests to ensure that the user is authenticated.

### 5. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
- **Proxy:** Nginx

### 6. Relationships Between Models

- **User and Discussion:**
  - Each `Discussion` document has a `userId` field that references the `User` model, indicating the user who created the discussion.
  - This relationship allows us to query which discussions a specific user has created.

- **User and Comment:**
  - Each `Comment` document has a `userId` field that references the `User` model, indicating the user who made the comment.
  - This relationship allows us to query which comments a specific user has made.

- **Discussion and Comment:**
  - Each `Comment` document has a `discussionId` field that references the `Discussion` model, indicating the discussion to which the comment belongs.
  - This relationship allows us to query all comments related to a specific discussion.

- **User and Follow:**
  - The `User` model contains `followers` and `following` fields, which are arrays of `User` references.
  - This relationship allows us to manage and query the users each user is following and their followers.

### 7. Additional Considerations

- **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse, we will implement rate limiting on our API endpoints.
- **Caching:** We can use Redis to cache frequently accessed data, such as user profiles.

### 8. Conclusion

This design ensures that our discussion platform is scalable, maintainable, and robust, allowing for easy extension and modification as needed. By utilizing a microservice architecture, we can develop and deploy each service independently, making it easier to manage and scale specific parts of the system.
